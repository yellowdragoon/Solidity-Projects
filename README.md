# Solidity-Basics
A repository of my Solidity mini-projects/code.

Currently, there are 2 main folders:
-Hacking Solidity contains contracts that can be exploited in some form, as well as the exploit and preventative measures
-Applications include more general contracts that can serve some basic functions
